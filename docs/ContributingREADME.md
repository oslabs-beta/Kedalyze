## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests with [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

- All code changes will happen through pull requests
- Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
  1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
  2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
  3. Ensure the test suite passes.
  4. Make sure your code lints.
  5. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/Kedalyze/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](). Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
  - [Example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report
  - [Another example](http://www.openradar.me/11905408) from Craig Hockenberry

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We recommend using a Consistent Coding Style. For more information about the Consistent Coding Style, see the Airbnb [documentation](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/)

- Two spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run eslint` for style unification
